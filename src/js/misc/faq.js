  afford a lighthouse we'll take a windmill)."
}, {
  question: "Do you handle payment if people working on a project \
  agree to some sort of compensation?",

  Or cash. Or anything that isn't us. We don't handle that."

  question: "How does it work?",
  answer: "Technology, man. Technology."

  question: "How do I get started?",
